        <h1>Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol</h1>

        <p>The content of this page has been slightly adapted from the Wikipedia page on <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol">Hyper Text Coffee Pot
                Control Protocol.</a></p>

        <p>The <strong>Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP)</strong> is a facetious communication protocol
            for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots. It is specified in RFC 2324, published on 1 April
            1998 as an April Fools' Day RFC, as part of an April Fools prank. An extension, HTCPCP-TEA, was published as
            RFC 7168 on 1 April 2014 to support brewing teas, which is also an April Fools' Day RFC.</p>

        <p>RFC 2324 was written by Larry Masinter, who describes it as a satire, saying "This has a serious purpose - it
            identifies many of the ways in which HTTP has been extended inappropriately." The wording of the protocol
            made it clear that it was not entirely serious; for example, it notes that "there is a strong, dark, rich
            requirement for a protocol designed espressoly [sic] for the brewing of coffee".</p>

        <p>Despite the joking nature of its origins, or perhaps because of it, the protocol has remained as a minor
            presence online. The editor Emacs includes a fully functional client side implementation of it, and a number
            of bug reports exist complaining about Mozilla's lack of support for the protocol. Ten years after the
            publication of HTCPCP, the Web-Controlled Coffee Consortium (WC3) published a first draft of "HTCPCP
            Vocabulary in RDF" in parody of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) "HTTP Vocabulary in RDF".</p>

        <p>On April 1, 2014, RFC 7168 extended HTCPCP to fully handle teapots.</p>

        <p>HTCPCP is an extension of HTTP. HTCPCP requests are identified with the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
            scheme coffee (or the corresponding word in any other of the 29 listed languages) and contain several
            additions to the HTTP methods:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><code>BREW</code> or <code>POST</code></dt>
            <dd>Causes the HTCPCP server to brew coffee. Using POST for this purpose is deprecated. A new HTTP request
                header field "Accept-Additions" is proposed, supporting optional additions including Cream, Whole-milk,
                Vanilla, Raspberry, Whisky, Aquavit, etc.</dd>
            <dt><code>GET</code></dt>
            <dd>"Retrieves" coffee from the HTCPCP server.</dd>
            <dt><code>PROPFIND</code></dt>
            <dd>Returns metadata about the coffee.</dd>
            <dt><code>WHEN</code></dt>
            <dd><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/say_when">Says "when"</a>, causing the HTCPCP server to stop
                pouring milk into the coffee (if applicable).</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>It also defines two error responses:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><code>406 Not Acceptable</code></dt>
            <dd>The HTCPCP server is unable to provide the requested addition for some reason; the response should
                indicate a list of available additions. The RFC observes that "In practice, most automated coffee pots
                cannot currently provide additions."</dd>
            <dt><code>418 I'm a teapot</code></dt>
            <dd>The HTCPCP server is a teapot; the resulting entity body "may be short and stout" (a reference to the
                song "I'm a Little Teapot"). Demonstrations of this behaviour exist.</dd>

        <p>On 5 August 2017, Mark Nottingham, chairman of the IETF HTTPBIS Working Group, called for the removal of
            status code 418 "I'm a teapot" from the Node.js platform, a code implemented in reference to the original
            418 "I'm a teapot" established in Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol. On 6 August 2017, Nottingham
            requested that references to 418 "I'm a teapot" be removed from the programming language Go and subsequently
            from Python's Requests and ASP.NET's HttpAbstractions library as well.</p>

        <p>In response, 15-year-old developer Shane Brunswick created a website, save418.com, and established the "Save
            418 Movement", asserting that references to 418 "I'm a teapot" in different projects serve as "a reminder
            that the underlying processes of computers are still made by humans". Brunswick's site went viral in the
            hours following its publishing, garnering thousands of upvotes on the social platform Reddit, and causing
            the mass adoption of the "#save418" Twitter hashtag he introduced on his site. Heeding the public outcry,
            Node.js, Go, Python's Requests, and ASP.NET's HttpAbstractions library decided against removing 418 "I'm a
            teapot" from their respective projects. The unanimous support from the aforementioned projects and the
            general public prompted Nottingham to begin the process of having 418 marked as a reserved HTTP status code,
            ensuring that 418 will not be replaced by an official status code for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <p>On 5 October 2020, Python 3.9 released with an updated http library including <code>418 IM_A_TEAPOT</code>
            status code. In the corresponding pull request, the Save 418 movement was directly cited in support of
            adoption.</p>
